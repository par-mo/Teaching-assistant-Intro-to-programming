Linear regression: 
	⁃	One of the most basic and popular algorithms in machine learning. 
	⁃	Linear regression is the first algorithm we come across.
	⁃	It finds the best possible line which fits that training set and then 	 predicts the unseen entity (based on our target variable)
	⁃	Linear relationship between feature (one or more) and target variable.

	⁃	Example: 
		For generality, we define:
			— x as feature vector, i.e x = [x_1, x_2, …., x_n],
			— y as response vector, i.e y = [y_1, y_2, …., y_n]
			— for n observations (in above example, n=10).
